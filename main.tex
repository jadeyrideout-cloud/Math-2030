\title{Project Proposal}

\section{Overview}
\section{Research Questions}
Our two main research questions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How many simple rule changes must be made to block dominoes to make the game of mathematical interest?
    \item At what point do these rule changes effect the playability of the game?
\end{itemize}
The first of these questions will be solved via the analysis as outlined in section 3, though the second is qualitative in nature. We believe question 2 is as important as the first, especially in research beyond this proposal, as research into a game that is not enjoyable would be a waste of time and resources.
\section{Methods}
\section{Data Collection}
Data collection Will be done through two sessions with small groups. Games of each rule set will be played, with images taken of the end state and data tracked in a spreadsheet. Analysis will be done after all data is collected, with some graphs produced. Qualitative remarks on each rule set will be gathered from all participants to help define research question 2.
